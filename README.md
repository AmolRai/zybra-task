This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Summary

I created this project using Next.js, tanstack/react-table, tanstack/react-query, and shadcn/ui. Some libraries were new to me. 

I implemented the following features:  
1. Sorting by product title, description, or category.  
2. Column-based filtering for title, description, or category.  
3. A global search input for filtering across all columns.  
4. Pagination for handling large datasets.  

The main challenge was understanding how these libraries work together, especially managing React Table with features like search, filtering, and pagination. It was tricky initially but a great learning experience!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
